### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am a professional software developer.
- I have experience developing on a variety of Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 sites.
- I've also written contributed modules on Drupal.org, and contributed to Drupal core development
- I'm comfortable implementing contributed and custom modules in Drupal.
- I believe in keeping things maintainable, cleanly written, and reliable.
- I am a big fan of agile software development.
- I am very comfortable with git, composer, PHP, bash, SASS, Javascript, and am a self learner and can pick up new technologies quickly.
- I'm very comfortable working in Linux based systems.

I am open to remediation and cleanup of existing sites, or helping to create and launch new sites. I have experience using platforms like Pantheon, AWS, Google Cloud Platform. I'm also happy to hop into your custom built server.

I am comfortable working alone or with an existing team of any size. I'm able to interface and communicate with non-technical staff when necessary.

Please feel free to reach out if you have a project that you're interested in discussing! ðŸ“«
